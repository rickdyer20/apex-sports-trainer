Production WSGI Entry Point - Hybrid Basketball Analysis Service
===============================================================

Smart deployment strategy that ensures instant service availability:
✅ Attempts hybrid service (CV-ready with graceful fallback)
✅ Falls back to full service if hybrid not available
✅ Falls back to lightweight if full service fails
✅ Provides loading page as last resort

This approach guarantees your service is always available while
computer vision dependencies load in the background.
