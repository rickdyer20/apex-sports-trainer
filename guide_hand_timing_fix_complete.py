GUIDE HAND DETECTION TIMING FIX - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

This document summarizes the successful fix to prevent guide hand detection from being 
too strict and flagging natural hand positions after ball release.

print("PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:")
print("  ‚ùå Guide hand detection was too strict")
print("  ‚ùå Flagged issues well after ball release when hands drop naturally")
print("  ‚ùå Release phase extended too far into follow-through period")
print("  ‚ùå False positives from normal post-release hand movement")
print()

print("ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:")
print("  ‚Ä¢ Release phase extended 15 frames (0.5s) after peak wrist velocity")
print("  ‚Ä¢ Guide hand analyzed throughout entire Release phase")
print("  ‚Ä¢ No distinction between ball-in-hands vs. post-release periods")
print("  ‚Ä¢ Natural hand separation after release was flagged as flaw")

print("FIXES IMPLEMENTED:")

print("1. üîß SHORTENED RELEASE PHASE DURATION")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Before: Release phase = peak_velocity - 5 to peak_velocity + 15")
print("   ‚Ä¢ After: Release phase = peak_velocity - 5 to peak_velocity + 8")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Reduction: 7 frames (0.23 seconds) less post-release analysis")

print("   ‚Ä¢ Before: Analyzed throughout entire Release phase")

print("3. üîß IMPROVED DETECTION LOGGING")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Added detailed logging for guide hand analysis decisions")
