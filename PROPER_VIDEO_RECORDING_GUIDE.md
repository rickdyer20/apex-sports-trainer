## 📐 The Golden Rules

### 1. **ALWAYS Hold Your Phone Sideways (Landscape Mode)**
```
✅ CORRECT: Wide rectangle (landscape)

└─────────────────────────────┘

❌ WRONG: Tall rectangle (portrait)  
┌───────────┐

│           │
└───────────┘
```

### 2. **Lock Your Screen Rotation Before Recording**

**iPhone Users:**
1. Swipe down from top-right corner (Control Center)
2. Tap the rotation lock button 🔒
3. Turn phone sideways to landscape

**Android Users:**
1. Swipe down to open notification panel
2. Find and tap "Auto-rotate" to disable it
3. Turn phone sideways to landscape

### 3. **Position Yourself 8-10 Feet to the Side**
- Stand to the **side** of the shooter (not behind or in front)
- Make sure you can see the shooter's **full body** from feet to fingertips
- The basketball hoop can be in the frame but isn't required

### 4. **Keep Your Phone Steady**
- Use **both hands** to hold your phone
- **Don't follow the ball** with the camera
- Focus on the shooter throughout the entire motion
- Use volume buttons to start/stop recording for better stability

## 🏀 What Your Video Should Look Like

### Perfect Basketball Shot Video Checklist:
- [ ] Phone held horizontally (landscape mode)
- [ ] Screen rotation locked before recording
- [ ] Shooter's full body visible (head to toes)
- [ ] Camera positioned to the side (not front/back)
- [ ] Steady recording throughout the shot
- [ ] Good lighting on the shooter
- [ ] One shot per video (don't record multiple shots)

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Recording in portrait mode** (tall, narrow video)
2. **Standing too close** - can't see full shooting form
3. **Standing too far** - shooter appears too small
4. **Following the ball** - makes analysis difficult
5. **Recording multiple shots** - confuses the analysis
6. **Poor lighting** - makes pose detection harder
7. **Shaky footage** - reduces analysis accuracy

## 💡 Pro Tips for Best Results

### Lighting:
- Record outdoors during daylight for best results
- Indoors: make sure shooter is well-lit
- Avoid backlighting (don't record with bright light behind shooter)

### Timing:
- Start recording **before** the shooter begins their motion
- Keep recording through the complete follow-through
- Don't stop recording until the ball leaves their hand

### Multiple Angles:
- For comprehensive analysis, record from the **shooting side**
- This gives the best view of shooting hand mechanics
- Guide hand can be analyzed from front view or opposite side

## 📊 Why We Don't Auto-Rotate Your Videos

1. **Quality Loss** - Rotation can degrade video quality
2. **Aspect Ratio Issues** - May crop important parts of your shot
