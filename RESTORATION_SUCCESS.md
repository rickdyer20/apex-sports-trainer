## ✅ **SUCCESS - Working Version Restored!**

I've successfully restored your basketball analysis service from git commit `4e4f299` - the "Production-Ready Basketball Analysis Service v2.0" version that was working **before** all the deployment manipulations.

## 🔧 **What Was Restored**

- ✅ **requirements.txt** - Full dependencies including MediaPipe 0.10.7
- ✅ **web_app.py** - Complete Flask application (1,390 lines)
- ✅ **basketball_analysis_service.py** - Enhanced analysis engine

### Enhanced Features Preserved:
- ✅ **Enhanced thumb flick detection** (25° threshold)
- ✅ **Expanded camera angle support** (front, left, right, angled)
- ✅ **Refined elbow flare detection** 
- ✅ **Improved wrist snap analysis**
- ✅ **Optimized knee bend detection**
- ✅ **Advanced fluidity analysis**
- ✅ **12+ flaw detection types**

## 🚀 **Start Your Restored Service**

```

### Option 2: Direct Start
```bash
python web_app.py
```

### Option 3: Flask Command
```bash

✅ Basketball Analysis Service creates without errors  
✅ All dependencies available (Flask, MediaPipe, OpenCV, NumPy)  
✅ Enhanced features intact from commit 4e4f299

## 🔍 **Why This Version Works**

This is from **before** all the deployment manipulations where we:
- Removed dependencies to fit Render constraints
- Modified requirements.txt multiple times
- Created minimal versions that broke functionality

The restored version has:
- **Complete dependency set** (27 packages vs 4 in broken version)
- **Full MediaPipe support** for pose detection
- **All enhanced features** you requested
- **Production-ready code** without deployment compromises

## 🎉 **Ready to Test!**

Your basketball analysis service is now restored to full working condition. Test it with basketball shot videos to confirm the enhanced thumb flick detection works as expected!
