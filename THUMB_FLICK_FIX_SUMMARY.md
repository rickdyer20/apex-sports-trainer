# Thumb Flick Detection Improvements Summary
## Issue: Brandon front video analysis missed obvious thumb flick

### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Overly strict threshold**: Code used 35° threshold instead of configured 20-25°
2. **Limited camera coverage**: Only supported right_side_view and front_view
3. **Restrictive phase timing**: Only analyzed Follow-Through phase
4. **Conservative visibility**: Guide hand marked as invisible from side angles
5. **Insufficient severity scaling**: Severity calculation too conservative

### Fixes Applied:

#### 1. Lowered Detection Threshold
- **Before**: 35° (overly strict)
- **After**: 25° (catches obvious cases while avoiding false positives)
- **Impact**: Will detect more genuine thumb interference

#### 2. Expanded Camera Angle Support
- **Before**: ['right_side_view', 'front_view']
- **After**: ['right_side_view', 'front_view', 'angled_view', 'left_side_view']
- **Impact**: Covers "Brandon front video" scenarios shot from different angles

#### 3. Enhanced Phase Coverage
- **Before**: Follow-Through only
- **After**: Release AND Follow-Through phases
- **Impact**: Catches thumb interference during ball release, not just after

#### 4. Improved Guide Hand Visibility Detection
- **Before**: Hard False for guide hand from left_side_view
- **After**: Dynamic visibility based on actual landmark detection (>20% threshold)
- **Impact**: Allows thumb flick detection even from side angles with partial visibility

#### 5. Enhanced Severity Calculation
- **Before**: Conservative linear scaling
- **After**: 
  - Base severity from 20° deviation
  - Extra penalty for extreme cases (>40°)
  - Better scaling: `(actual - 20) * 1.2`
- **Impact**: More accurate severity assessment

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Catches obvious thumb flicks that were previously missed
- ✅ Works from multiple camera angles including "front" videos
- ✅ Maintains accuracy by avoiding false positives
- ✅ Better coaching feedback with improved severity assessment

### Technical Details:
```python
# New Detection Logic:
if actual > 25:  # Lowered from 35 degrees
    base_severity = (actual - 20) * 1.2  # Start penalty at 20° deviation
    severity = min(base_severity, 30)    # Cap at reasonable maximum
    
    # Extra penalty for extreme thumb movement (>40°)
    if actual > 40:
        severity = min(severity + 10, 40)
```

### Camera Angle Coverage:
- **left_side_view**: Now supported (common for "front" videos)
- **right_side_view**: Always supported
- **front_view**: Always supported
- **angled_view**: Now supported

This should resolve the issue where obvious thumb flicks were being missed in Brandon's front video analysis.
