## 📋 **HOW IT WORKS**

### 1. **Video Upload**
```
User uploads basketball shot video → Web interface processes → Background analysis begins
```

### 2. **Analysis Process**
```
MediaPipe pose detection → Biomechanical analysis → Flaw identification → Frame still generation
```

### 3. **Flaw Detection**
```
8 Flaw Types Detected:
├── Elbow Flare
├── Insufficient Knee Bend  
├── Excessive Knee Bend
├── Poor Follow-Through
├── Guide Hand Interference
├── Balance Issues
├── Rushing Shot
└── Inconsistent Release Point
```

### 4. **Still Generation**
```
For each detected flaw:
├── Capture frame at peak flaw moment
├── Add educational overlay with:
│   ├── Flaw title and severity
│   ├── Plain language explanation
│   ├── Specific coaching tip
│   ├── Recommended drill
│   └── Visual highlighting of problem areas
└── Save as high-quality PNG
```

### 5. **Results Delivery**
```
Web Interface Displays:
├── Analyzed video (downloadable)
├── Flaw analysis cards with details
├── Individual still downloads
└── Bulk ZIP download option
```

## 🎯 **FLAW ANALYSIS FEATURES**

### **Visual Overlays Include:**
