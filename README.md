## Development

### Local Testing
Place a basketball shot video named `user_shot.mp4` in the project directory for realistic testing. The script will create a dummy video if none exists.

### Configuration
Ideal shot parameters can be customized via `ideal_shot_guide.json`:

```json
{
  "release_elbow_angle": {"min": 160, "max": 180},
  "load_knee_angle": {"min": 110, "max": 130},
  "common_remedies": {
    "elbow_extension": "Focus on fully extending your elbow towards the basket.",
    "knee_drive": "Explode upwards by pushing through your heels."
  }
}
```

## Deployment

### Serverless Functions
The service is designed for deployment as AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Azure Functions with minimal modifications.

### Container Deployment
Can be containerized using Docker for deployment in Kubernetes or container services.

### Queue Integration
Supports integration with AWS SQS, Google Pub/Sub, or Azure Service Bus for scalable processing.
