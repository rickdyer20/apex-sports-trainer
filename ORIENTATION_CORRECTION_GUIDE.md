# 🔄 Orientation Correction - Quick Implementation Guide

## 🎯 What Was Added

Added simple orientation correction for video frames and stills that appear sideways in downloads. The correction:

- **Detects portrait aspect ratios** (< 0.75) and applies 90° clockwise rotation
- **Detects very wide aspect ratios** (> 1.8) and applies 90° counter-clockwise rotation  
- **Leaves normal landscape videos** (0.75-1.8 aspect ratio) unchanged
- **Can be easily disabled** with a single flag change

## ⚡ Easy Toggle On/Off

### Method 1: Using the Toggle Script
```bash
# To disable orientation correction
python toggle_orientation.py off

# To enable orientation correction  
python toggle_orientation.py on

# To check current status
python toggle_orientation.py
```

### Method 2: Manual Toggle
Edit `basketball_analysis_service.py` and change:
```python
ENABLE_ORIENTATION_CORRECTION = True  # To enable
ENABLE_ORIENTATION_CORRECTION = False # To disable
```

## 🔍 Where It's Applied

1. **Flaw Still Images**: Applied before saving frame stills for download packages
2. **Video Output**: Applied to each frame before writing to analyzed video

## 🧪 Testing

Test the logic with:
```bash
python test_orientation.py
```

## ⏪ How to Completely Remove (If Needed)

If the orientation correction causes issues, you can remove it entirely:

1. **Quick Disable**: Use `python toggle_orientation.py off`

2. **Complete Removal**: Remove these lines from `basketball_analysis_service.py`:
   - The `detect_and_correct_orientation()` function (around line 481-515)  
   - The two calls to `detect_and_correct_orientation()` in the video processing section

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

- **Normal landscape videos**: No change (aspect ratio 0.75-1.8)
- **Portrait/sideways videos**: Automatically rotated to landscape orientation
- **Very wide videos**: Counter-rotated if needed
- **Failed cases**: Falls back to original frame with warning in logs

## 📊 Monitoring

Check logs for messages like:
- `"Applied 90° clockwise rotation (aspect ratio was X.XX)"`
- `"Applied 90° counter-clockwise rotation (aspect ratio was X.XX)"`
- `"Orientation correction failed: ..., using original frame"`

The correction is conservative and will only rotate when the aspect ratio clearly indicates an orientation issue.
