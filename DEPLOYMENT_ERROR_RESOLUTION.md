# üö® Deployment Error Resolution Guide

## ‚ùå Error Received:
**Deploy Error: Non-Zero Exit Code**
- Component Issues: apex-sports-trainer2 deploy failed
- Container exited with non-zero exit code

---

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED - ROUND 2:**

### üéØ **Specific Fixes Based on DigitalOcean Diagnostics:**

**DigitalOcean identified exactly what was wrong:**
1. **Missing system dependencies:** `libGL.so.1` required by OpenCV
2. **Incorrect gunicorn worker type:** causing worker process failures

**MY FIXES:**
1. ‚úÖ **Added `apt-packages` file** with required system libraries
2. ‚úÖ **Switched to `opencv-python-headless`** (no GUI dependencies needed)
3. ‚úÖ **Updated gunicorn configuration** with sync worker class
4. ‚úÖ **Added essential dependencies** (NumPy, Pillow) for basic functionality
5. ‚úÖ **Enhanced diagnostic testing** to verify OpenCV functionality

### üìã **What Changed:**
1. **App Command:** Now using `web_app_diagnostic:app` instead of `web_app:app`
2. **Requirements:** Stripped down to minimal Flask dependencies
3. **Features:** Diagnostic mode with dependency testing

---

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:**

### 1. **Redeploy on DigitalOcean**
The diagnostic version should deploy successfully now. In your DigitalOcean dashboard:
- The app should **automatically redeploy** from the new GitHub commit
- Or manually trigger a redeploy if auto-deploy is disabled

### 2. **Test the Diagnostic Version**
Once deployed, visit your app URL and you should see:
- ‚úÖ **"Diagnostic Mode Active"** page
- ‚úÖ **Working health check** at `/health`
- ‚úÖ **Dependency test** at `/test`

### 3. **Check Which Dependencies Failed**
Visit: `https://your-app-url.ondigitalocean.app/test`
This will tell you exactly which dependencies are causing issues:
- OpenCV, MediaPipe, NumPy, ReportLab, etc.

---

## üîç **COMMON CAUSES & SOLUTIONS:**

### **Most Likely Issues:**

#### 1. **OpenCV Installation Problem**
- **Problem:** `opencv-python` often fails on minimal Linux containers
- **Solution:** Will need to use `opencv-python-headless` instead

#### 2. **MediaPipe Compatibility**  
- **Problem:** MediaPipe may not support the Python version or architecture
- **Solution:** May need specific version or alternative approach

#### 3. **Memory Issues During Build**
- **Problem:** Heavy ML libraries exceed build memory limits
- **Solution:** May need larger instance size during build

#### 4. **System Dependencies Missing**
- **Problem:** OpenCV needs system libraries (libGL, libglib, etc.)
- **Solution:** May need custom Dockerfile with system packages

---

## üìä **MONITORING THE NEW DEPLOYMENT:**

### **Expected Timeline:**
- **Build Time:** 1-3 minutes (much faster with minimal dependencies)
- **Deploy Time:** 30-60 seconds
- **Total:** Should be live in 2-4 minutes

### **Success Indicators:**
1. ‚úÖ **Green "Running" status** in DigitalOcean dashboard
2. ‚úÖ **App URL loads** with "Diagnostic Mode Active" message
3. ‚úÖ **Health check works** at `/health`
4. ‚úÖ **No more "non-zero exit code" errors**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **NEXT PHASE: GRADUAL FEATURE RESTORATION**

Once the diagnostic version works, we'll:

### Phase 1: Add Basic Dependencies
```bash
# Add these back to requirements.txt one by one:
numpy==1.24.3
Pillow==10.0.1
requests==2.31.0
```

### Phase 2: Add Computer Vision
```bash
# Test these carefully (likely culprits):
opencv-python-headless==4.8.1.78  # Note: headless version
mediapipe==0.10.7
```

### Phase 3: Add Full Features
```bash
# Once CV works, add the rest:
reportlab==4.0.4
imageio==2.31.5
Flask-CORS==4.0.0
```

### Phase 4: Switch Back to Full App
- Change `app.yaml` back to `web_app:app`
- Test full basketball analysis functionality

---

## üöÄ **ACTION REQUIRED:**

### **Right Now:**
1. **Wait 2-4 minutes** for the new deployment to complete
2. **Check your DigitalOcean dashboard** - should show "Running" status
3. **Visit your app URL** - should see diagnostic page
4. **Test the `/health` endpoint** - should return JSON status
5. **Check `/test` endpoint** - will show which dependencies are missing

### **If Still Failing:**
The diagnostic version uses only basic Flask - if this still fails, the issue is:
- **DigitalOcean configuration problem**
- **GitHub repository access issue**  
- **App.yaml syntax error**
- **Python version incompatibility**

---

## üì± **UPDATE ME:**

Please let me know:
1. **Does the diagnostic version deploy successfully?**
2. **What does the `/test` endpoint show?**  
3. **Any error messages in DigitalOcean logs?**

Based on your results, I'll create the next fix to get your full basketball analysis app running! üèÄ

## üéØ **CONFIDENCE LEVEL: HIGH**

This diagnostic approach should identify and fix the deployment issue. The minimal Flask app with gradual dependency addition is a proven method for resolving DigitalOcean deployment problems.
