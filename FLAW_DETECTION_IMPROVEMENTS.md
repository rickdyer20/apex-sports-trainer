# Basketball Analysis Flaw Detection Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the flaw detection system to be more discerning and reduce false positives that were flagging minor variations as significant flaws.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Statistical Validation
- **Evidence Requirement**: Now requires at least 1/3 of phase frames to show a flaw before reporting it
- **Severity Averaging**: Uses average severity across frames instead of worst-case scenario
- **Minimum Threshold**: Only reports flaws with severity ≥ 10, and prioritizes those ≥ 15

### 2. Enhanced Thresholds
- **Elbow Flare**: Increased from 15° to 20° deviation threshold
- **Knee Bend Issues**: Increased from 20° to 25° variance threshold  
- **Wrist Snap**: Increased from 15° to 20° deviation threshold
- **Guide Hand Thumb**: Increased from 10° to 15° threshold
- **Guide Hand Position**: Increased from 15° to 25° deviation threshold
- **Head Rotation**: Increased from 8° to 12° threshold
- **Motion Smoothness**: Increased from 0.3 to 0.5 threshold
- **Balance Issues**: Increased from 10° to 15° body lean threshold

### 3. Physiological Range Validation
- **Elbow Angles**: Only accepts 60-200° range (filters impossible angles)
- **Knee Angles**: Only accepts 60-180° range (realistic human movement)
- **Wrist Angles**: Only accepts 20-160° range (prevents sensor noise)
- **Head Rotation**: Limited to ±45° range (reasonable head movement)
- **Body Lean**: Limited to ±30° range (realistic balance variation)

### 4. Measurement Quality Checks
- **Hand Distance**: Requires minimum 30px separation for guide hand analysis
- **Thumb Angle**: Only analyzes 30-150° range to avoid landmark detection errors
- **Motion Smoothness**: Capped at 5.0 to prevent velocity calculation outliers
- **Landmark Validation**: Ensures key landmarks exist before calculating metrics

### 5. Contextual Analysis
- **Release Point Consistency**: Now requires multiple frames and significant variance (40px+)
- **Guide Hand Analysis**: Validates hand positions are anatomically reasonable
- **Motion Analysis**: Prevents single-frame anomalies from triggering flaw detection

### 6. Reporting Improvements
- **Flaw Limit**: Reduced from 8 to 5 maximum reported flaws
- **Significance Filter**: Prioritizes flaws with severity ≥ 15
- **Conservative Reporting**: Returns 2-3 moderate flaws if no severe ones exist

## Expected Results
- **Fewer False Positives**: Significantly reduced incorrect flaw detection
- **More Meaningful Feedback**: Only reports flaws that actually impact shooting performance
- **Better User Experience**: Focused on actionable feedback rather than minor variations
- **Improved Accuracy**: Enhanced validation prevents sensor noise from triggering alerts

## Technical Details
- All angle calculations now include range validation
- Enhanced statistical analysis requires consistent evidence across multiple frames
- Improved landmark quality checking prevents poor pose detection from causing false readings
- Motion analysis includes smoothing and outlier detection

The system now provides more accurate, actionable feedback while maintaining the enhanced capabilities for detecting guide hand positioning, shot fluidity, and eye tracking issues.
