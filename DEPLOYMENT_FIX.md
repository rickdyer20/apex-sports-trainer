# 🚨 PAGE NOT LOADING - DEPLOYMENT FIX

## 🔍 Problem Identified

Your page is not loading because **MediaPipe is missing** from your requirements.txt. The "ultra-minimal" version was too minimal - it removed essential dependencies.

## ✅ IMMEDIATE FIX

### 1. Fixed Requirements.txt
I've updated your `requirements.txt` with the essential dependencies:

```
Flask==3.0.0
gunicorn==21.0.0
opencv-python-headless==4.8.0
numpy==1.24.0
mediapipe==0.10.9        # ← THIS WAS MISSING!
reportlab==4.0.0
Pillow==10.0.0
```

### 2. Redeploy to Render (5 minutes)

```bash
# Commit the fix
git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Fix: Add missing MediaPipe dependency for basketball analysis"
git push origin master
```

Then go to your **Render Dashboard** and:
1. Click your service
2. Click **"Manual Deploy"** → **"Deploy latest commit"**
3. Wait 3-5 minutes for build to complete
4. Test your site

## 🔧 Alternative: Quick Local Test

To verify the fix works locally:

```bash
python diagnose_deployment.py
```

This will confirm your app works before redeploying.

## 📊 Expected Results After Fix

✅ **Build will succeed** - All dependencies will install correctly
✅ **App will start** - No more import errors  
✅ **Page will load** - Basketball analysis interface will appear
✅ **Video analysis will work** - Full functionality restored

## 🚨 If Still Having Issues

### Check Render Logs:
1. Go to Render Dashboard → Your Service
2. Click **"Logs"** tab
3. Look for error messages during build/startup

### Common Render Issues:
- **Memory limit exceeded**: Upgrade to Starter Plan ($7/month)
- **Build timeout**: Dependencies taking too long (normal with MediaPipe)
- **Port binding**: Make sure your service uses `$PORT` environment variable

## 🎯 Root Cause

The issue was that during our optimization attempts for Render, we removed MediaPipe from requirements.txt to try to fit in the free tier. However, your basketball analysis service **requires MediaPipe** for pose detection - it's not optional.

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** the requirements.txt fix
2. **Redeploy on Render** (should work now)
3. **Test with a basketball video** 
4. **Confirm thumb flick detection** is working

Your basketball analysis service will be back online with full functionality!
