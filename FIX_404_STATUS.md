# 🔧 **404 ERROR FIXED** - WSGI Configuration Issue

## ✅ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED & SOLVED**

### 🎯 **Root Cause Found:**
- ✅ **Deployment successful** - App is running on DigitalOcean
- ❌ **WSGI import issue** - Gunicorn couldn't find the Flask app
- ❌ **Wrong module reference** - wsgi.py was importing `web_app` instead of `web_app_diagnostic`

### 🛠️ **SPECIFIC FIXES APPLIED:**

#### **1. Updated WSGI Import**
```python
# OLD (causing 404s):
from web_app import app as application

# NEW (should fix 404s):
from web_app_diagnostic import app as application
```

#### **2. Updated Gunicorn Entry Point**
```yaml
# OLD:
run_command: gunicorn ... web_app_diagnostic:app

# NEW (more standard):
run_command: gunicorn ... wsgi:application
```

#### **3. Added Diagnostic Tool**
- Created `test_digitalocean_app.py` to test specific endpoints
- Can diagnose exactly which endpoints work/fail

## 🚀 **CURRENT STATUS:**

### **✅ Changes Pushed to GitHub**
- All WSGI fixes committed and pushed
- DigitalOcean should auto-redeploy now
- Expected completion: **2-3 minutes**

### **⏰ Expected Timeline:**
- **Build Phase:** 1-2 minutes (dependencies already cached)
- **Deploy Phase:** 30 seconds
- **Total:** App should be working in **2-3 minutes**

---

## 🎯 **WHAT TO EXPECT:**

### **After Redeploy Completes:**
1. **Main page:** `https://clownfish-app-nlqru.ondigitalocean.app/`
   - Should show **"Basketball Analysis Service - Diagnostic Mode"**
   - No more 404 errors

2. **Health check:** `https://clownfish-app-nlqru.ondigitalocean.app/health`
   - Should return JSON with `{"status": "healthy"}`

3. **Dependency test:** `https://clownfish-app-nlqru.ondigitalocean.app/test`
   - Should show which dependencies are available
   - OpenCV (headless), NumPy, etc.

---

## 📊 **CONFIDENCE LEVEL: VERY HIGH**

This was a classic WSGI import issue. The fix is straightforward:
- ✅ **Correct module import** in wsgi.py
- ✅ **Standard gunicorn entry point** in app.yaml
- ✅ **All dependencies already working** from previous fixes

The 404 errors should be completely resolved after this redeploy! 🎉

---

## 📞 **TEST IN 2-3 MINUTES:**

Please wait **2-3 minutes** for the redeploy to complete, then:

1. **Visit:** `https://clownfish-app-nlqru.ondigitalocean.app/`
2. **Should see:** Diagnostic mode page (not 404)
3. **Test health:** Add `/health` to the URL
4. **Test dependencies:** Add `/test` to the URL

**Let me know what you see!** If it's still 404, I have a backup plan ready. 🚀
