# üåê DEPLOY WITHOUT SSH - Control Panel Method

If you can't use SSH from your local machine, here's how to deploy using your hosting control panel:

## **Method 1: cPanel/Hosting Control Panel Deployment**

### **Step 1: Access Your Hosting Control Panel**
1. Login to your hosting provider's control panel
2. Look for "File Manager" or "Files" section
3. Navigate to your website's root directory (usually `public_html`)

### **Step 2: Upload Deployment Package**
1. In File Manager, click "Upload"
2. Upload `apexsports_deployment.zip` from your local machine
3. Right-click the uploaded file and select "Extract" or "Unzip"

### **Step 3: Run Commands via Terminal**
If your hosting provides a Terminal/SSH interface:
1. Look for "Terminal" in your control panel
2. Navigate to your website directory
3. Run these commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip3 install flask stripe python-dotenv gunicorn

# Set permissions
chmod +x complete_web_app.py
chmod 644 .env

# Start the service
python3 complete_web_app.py
```

## **Method 2: Git Clone via Control Panel**

If your hosting supports Git:
1. Open Terminal in your control panel
2. Run: `git clone -b working-full-featured https://github.com/rickdyer20/apex-sports-trainer.git`
3. Navigate: `cd apex-sports-trainer`
4. Extract: `unzip -o apexsports_deployment.zip`
5. Install: `pip3 install flask stripe python-dotenv gunicorn`
6. Start: `python3 complete_web_app.py`

## **Method 3: Contact Hosting Support**

If the above don't work:
1. Contact your hosting provider's support
2. Ask them to help you:
   - Install Python packages: flask, stripe, python-dotenv, gunicorn
   - Run your Python application
   - Set up your domain to point to the application

## **üéØ Your Files Are Ready**

You have these files ready to upload:
- `apexsports_deployment.zip` (complete service)
- `server_setup.sh` (Linux setup script)
- All source files in your repository

**Choose the method that works with your hosting provider!**
