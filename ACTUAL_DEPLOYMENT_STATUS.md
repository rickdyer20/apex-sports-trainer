gunicorn>=21.0.0
opencv-python-headless>=4.8.0

reportlab>=4.0.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
psutil>=5.9.0
```

## ❓ **IS YOUR SERVICE ACTUALLY LIVE?**

### **To Check if Deployment Worked:**
1. **Go to your Render dashboard**: [render.com](https://render.com)
2. **Find your `apex-sports-trainer` service**
3. **Check the status**:
   - 🟢 **"Live"** = Service is working
   - 🔴 **"Build Failed"** = Deployment failed
   - 🟡 **"Building"** = Still deploying

### **Test Your Service URL:**
If status shows "Live", your service URL should be something like:
```
https://apex-sports-trainer-[random].onrender.com
```

**Try visiting:**
- Main page: `https://your-app.onrender.com/`
- Health check: `https://your-app.onrender.com/health`

## 🚨 **If Service is NOT Live**

The minimal dependencies we have **should work**, but if they're not:

### **Option 1: Try Ultra-Minimal Dependencies**
```
Flask==3.0.0
gunicorn==21.0.0
opencv-python-headless==4.8.0
numpy==1.24.0
```

### **Option 2: Check Render Build Logs**
- Look for specific error messages
- Check if MediaPipe is failing to install
- Look for memory/timeout issues

## 🎯 **Bottom Line**
**Check your Render dashboard first** - that will tell us if the current deployment is actually working or not!

If it shows "Live" ✅ → Your service is working
If it shows "Failed" ❌ → We need to troubleshoot further
