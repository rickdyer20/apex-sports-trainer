üéØ FLAW DETECTION CAPABILITIES
------------------------------
The system now detects and analyzes 8 specific shot flaws:

1. ELBOW FLARE
   ‚Ä¢ Detection: Shooting elbow positioned too far from body
   ‚Ä¢ Severity: Measured by angle deviation from ideal (15¬∞)
   ‚Ä¢ Plain Language: "Your shooting elbow is sticking out too far from your body"
   ‚Ä¢ Visual: Yellow circle highlighting problematic elbow position
   ‚Ä¢ Coaching: "Keep your shooting elbow directly under the ball"
   ‚Ä¢ Drill: "Wall shooting drill to practice proper elbow position"

2. INSUFFICIENT KNEE BEND  
   ‚Ä¢ Detection: Knee bend too shallow for proper power generation
   ‚Ä¢ Severity: Measured by angle deviation from ideal (140¬∞)
   ‚Ä¢ Plain Language: "You're not bending your knees enough for power"
   ‚Ä¢ Visual: Highlighting of knee joints with angle measurements
   ‚Ä¢ Coaching: "Bend your knees more to get into athletic position"
   ‚Ä¢ Drill: "Chair shooting drill to practice proper knee bend"

3. EXCESSIVE KNEE BEND
   ‚Ä¢ Detection: Knee bend too deep, wasting energy
   ‚Ä¢ Severity: Measured by angle below optimal range
   ‚Ä¢ Plain Language: "You're bending your knees too much, wasting energy"
   ‚Ä¢ Visual: Red highlighting of over-bent knees
   ‚Ä¢ Coaching: "Find comfortable athletic stance you can repeat"
   ‚Ä¢ Drill: "Mirror work to practice consistent stance"

4. POOR FOLLOW-THROUGH
   ‚Ä¢ Detection: Insufficient wrist snap on follow-through
   ‚Ä¢ Severity: Measured by wrist angle deviation
   ‚Ä¢ Plain Language: "Your follow-through needs work - snap your wrist down"
   ‚Ä¢ Visual: Highlighting of wrist position and trajectory
   ‚Ä¢ Coaching: "Snap wrist down like reaching into cookie jar"
   ‚Ä¢ Drill: "Bed shooting for wrist snap practice"

5. GUIDE HAND INTERFERENCE
   ‚Ä¢ Detection: Off-hand affecting ball trajectory
   ‚Ä¢ Severity: Measured by guide hand position deviation
   ‚Ä¢ Plain Language: "Your guide hand is interfering with the shot"
   ‚Ä¢ Visual: Highlighting problematic guide hand position
   ‚Ä¢ Coaching: "Guide hand should be a passenger, remove before release"
   ‚Ä¢ Drill: "One-handed shooting practice"

6. BALANCE ISSUES
   ‚Ä¢ Detection: Poor balance affecting shot accuracy
   ‚Ä¢ Severity: Measured by center of gravity deviation
   ‚Ä¢ Plain Language: "Your balance is off during the shot"
   ‚Ä¢ Visual: Balance line showing weight distribution
   ‚Ä¢ Coaching: "Focus on your base, land where you started"
   ‚Ä¢ Drill: "One-foot shooting for balance improvement"

7. RUSHING SHOT
   ‚Ä¢ Detection: Shot release too quick, lacks rhythm
   ‚Ä¢ Severity: Measured by phase duration analysis
   ‚Ä¢ Plain Language: "You're rushing your shot, slow down for consistency"
   ‚Ä¢ Visual: Timeline showing rushed phases
   ‚Ä¢ Coaching: "Count '1-2-shoot' to develop rhythm"
   ‚Ä¢ Drill: "Slow motion shooting practice"

8. INCONSISTENT RELEASE POINT
   ‚Ä¢ Detection: Release point varies significantly between frames
   ‚Ä¢ Severity: Measured by release position variance
   ‚Ä¢ Plain Language: "Your release point is not consistent"
   ‚Ä¢ Visual: Multiple release points shown with variance
   ‚Ä¢ Coaching: "Practice your shooting pocket consistently"
   ‚Ä¢ Drill: "Form shooting close to basket"
