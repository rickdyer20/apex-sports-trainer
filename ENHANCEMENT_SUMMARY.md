# Basketball Shot Analysis - Enhanced Flaw Detection

## Overview
Successfully enhanced the basketball shooting analysis system with more sophisticated flaw detection capabilities. The system previously mainly detected knee bend and elbow flare issues, but now includes comprehensive biomechanical analysis for a complete shooting form assessment.

## New Flaw Detection Capabilities

### 1. Guide Hand Analysis
- **Guide Hand Thumb Flick Detection**: Identifies when the guide hand thumb interferes during release
- **Guide Hand Positioning**: Detects if guide hand is positioned underneath the ball instead of on the side
- **Coaching Tips**: Specific drills like one-handed shooting and tennis ball exercises

### 2. Enhanced Wrist Snap Analysis
- **Improved Detection**: More precise measurement of wrist snap angles during follow-through
- **Follow-Through Duration**: Tracks how long the shooter holds their follow-through
- **Biomechanical Feedback**: Specific angle ranges and coaching cues

### 3. Shot Fluidity & Rhythm
- **Motion Smoothness**: Detects jerky or rushed shooting motions through velocity variance analysis
- **Shot Tempo Analysis**: Measures timing from load phase to release
- **Rhythm Consistency**: Identifies shooters who rush or have inconsistent timing

### 4. Eye Tracking & Focus
- **Head Stability Analysis**: Uses nose position relative to shoulders to detect head movement
- **Target Focus**: Identifies when shooters look away from the rim during their shot
- **Visual Consistency**: Tracks head rotation angles throughout the shooting motion

### 5. Release Point Consistency
- **Spatial Tracking**: Maps release point coordinates across multiple frames
- **Variance Detection**: Identifies inconsistent release points that affect accuracy
- **Shooting Pocket Analysis**: Ensures consistent release from the same position

## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Landmark Processing
```python
# New landmarks tracked:
- Left shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip (for guide hand analysis)
- Nose position (for head tracking)
- Index fingers and thumbs (for detailed hand analysis)
```

### Advanced Metrics Calculated
- Guide hand thumb angle deviation from neutral
- Guide hand position angle (side vs underneath)
- Head rotation angle relative to body centerline
- Body lean angle for balance assessment
- Motion smoothness through velocity variance
- Release point spatial coordinates and consistency

### New Coaching Framework
- **12 Comprehensive Flaw Types**: From basic knee bend to advanced guide hand mechanics
- **Specific Coaching Tips**: Targeted advice for each flaw type
- **Progressive Drill Suggestions**: From basic form shooting to advanced consistency drills
- **Severity Scoring**: Quantified assessment of each flaw's impact

## Configuration Updates

### Enhanced Thresholds (ideal_shot_guide.json)
```json
{
  "guide_hand_thumb_flick_max": 10,
  "guide_hand_position_deviation": 15,
  "head_rotation_max": 8,
  "motion_smoothness_threshold": 0.3,
  "follow_through_min_duration": 300
}
```
